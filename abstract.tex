Design, including cryo/cold plates and heat exchangers, and operational performance. (Might be split into two papers – design first, then operational performance after installation in Chile).
As the Commissioning Execution Plan (LSE-390) says, "The project team shall
deliver all reports documenting the as-built hardware and software including:
drawings, source code, modifications, compliance exceptions, and recommendations
for improvement." As a first step towards the delivery of documents that will describe the system at the
end of construction, we are assembling teams for producing of the order 40 papers
that eventually will be submitted to relevant professional journals. The immediate goal is to accomplish
all the writing that can be done without data analysis before the data
taking begins, and the team becomes much more busy and stressed.

This document provides the template for these papers.
